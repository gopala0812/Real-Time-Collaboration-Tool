EasyNote is a real-time collaborative note-taking web application designed to enable seamless teamwork and shared productivity. It allows multiple users to create or join shared notes using a unique Note ID and password, making it perfect for students, remote teams, study groups, or anyone who needs to brainstorm and collaborate in real time without the hassle of signing up.

Users can launch a new session instantly by generating a note ID and password or join an existing note simply by entering those credentials. The interface is clean and intuitive, with a powerful rich text editor powered by Quill.js, ensuring that formatting tools are available and accessible, even in dark mode. The platform also features real-time user activity notifications, live updates across all devices, and the ability to export your work as a PDF.

üìå Key Features
‚ú® 1. Create and Join Notes Instantly
Users can create a new note by entering their name, after which a random 6-character Note ID and 6-character Password are generated.

These credentials can be shared with others to allow collaborative editing.

Others can join the same note by entering their name, Note ID, and Password on the join page.

‚ú® 2. Real-Time Collaboration
As one user types, others see the changes live with no delay.

The application uses Socket.IO to push real-time updates to all connected users in the note session.

This eliminates the need for manual refreshes or reloads.

‚ú® 3. Quill Rich Text Editor
A professional and responsive editor allows text formatting such as bold, italics, headings, lists, and more.

It provides a writing experience that is both powerful and user-friendly.

‚ú® 4. Live User Tracking and Notifications
A sidebar displays the list of all current participants in the note.

Entry and exit of users trigger instant notifications to all other participants in the note.

The notifications panel shows events like "üîî Aakash joined the note" or "üö™ Pratik left the note".

‚ú® 5. Export to PDF
With one click, users can download the note as a PDF file.

The exported version maintains formatting, making it ideal for sharing or printing.

‚ú® 6. Light and Dark Mode
A toggle button allows users to switch between light and dark themes.

In dark mode, all UI elements including the Quill editor toolbar and notifications adapt for readability and aesthetics.

Special attention was given to styling the Quill editor toolbar in dark mode, fixing visibility issues with toolbar buttons and icons.

‚ú® 7. No Authentication Needed
There is no need to create accounts or log in.

Session information is stored in-browser using localStorage, and server-side note data is kept in memory.

This makes the tool extremely lightweight and fast for quick access.

‚úÖ Summary
EasyNote combines simplicity with robust features to deliver a smooth and modern real-time collaboration tool. Whether you're jotting down ideas with friends, planning a group assignment, or working remotely with your team, EasyNote keeps everyone on the same page‚Äîliterally.

With features like rich text editing, real-time sync, user tracking, notifications, PDF export, and dark mode support, it stands out as a minimalist yet capable collaborative platform.
